## Command Line Interpreter
➢Its job is to get and execute the next command 
statement

➢Request are given to the OS to deal with 
process creation, I/O handling, memory 
management and Networking

➢Shell is a command line interpreter

## What is a shell?
➢Shell is a program.

➢It acts as a command line interpreter.

➢Shell verifies the command usage.

➢Shell provides the basic programming 
capabilities.


## Command Line Interpreters
➢Shell: tools to execute user commands

➢Called “shells” because they hide the details on 
the underlying operating system under the shell’s 
surface.

➢Commands are input in a text terminal, either a 
window in a graphical environment or a text-only 
console.

➢Results are also displayed on the terminal. No 
graphics are needed at all.

➢Shells can be scripted: provide all the resources 
to write complex programs (variable, 
conditionals, iterations …)


### What are Shell Scripts?
➢In the simplest terms, a shell script is a file 
containing a series of commands. 

➢The shell reads this file and carries out the 
commands as though they have been entered 
directly on the command line.

➢The shell is somewhat unique, in that it is both a 
powerful command line interface to the system 
and a scripting language interpreter. 

➢Most of the things that can be done on the 
command line can be done in scripts, and most of 
the things that can be done in scripts can be done 
on the command line.
